Hi $requestor,
 
The git repo for your Redmine project $name has been created.
 
For git, project members with either the Manager or Developer role can check out and commit to the repository using one of two methods.
 
Method 1: https access
Clone using
`git clone https://projects.cecs.pdx.edu/git/$requestor-$name`
You will be asked for your MCECS username and password.
 
Method 2: ssh key access
Go to My Account and select the "Public Keys" tab. Here you can add ssh public keys for repository access. Once added, you can checkout the repository using
`git clone git@projects.cecs.pdx.edu:$requestor-$name.git`
If your ssh key is loaded, you will not need to supply a username or password.
 
Please let the CAT know if you have any additional questions.
